            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Milad Flores, a student passionate about embedded systems and C++ programming. Currently, I am
                pursuing my degree in Software Engineering at Chas Academy. My journey in technology began when I
                discovered my interest in how software can control hardware, which led me to explore embedded systems.
            </p>
            <p>As a student, I have been focusing on building a strong foundation in C++ programming and microcontroller
                development. Through various university projects and personal initiatives, I've gained hands-on
                experience working with microcontrollers, sensors, and developing software for embedded systems.</p>
            <p>In addition to my academic coursework, I enjoy exploring new technologies and projects in my spare time.
                I am always looking for opportunities to improve my skills, whether through online tutorials,
                participating in hackathons, or collaborating on open-source projects.</p>

            <h2>Work and Study Experience</h2>
            <p>I initially studied computer science for 2 Â½ years in the United States, building a foundation in
                programming and technology. After returning home, I worked as a project manager, where I honed skills in
                communication, organization and leadership. This experience strengthened my interest in software
                development, motivating me to pursue my true passion: becoming a software engineer.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Advanced Coursework:</strong> I am completing studies focused on C++ programming, embedded
                    systems, and microcontrollers, developing a comprehensive understanding of both software and
                    hardware integration.</li>

                <li><strong>Project Management Experience:</strong> In my role as a project manager, I oversaw multiple
                    projects, coordinated teams, and learned firsthand the importance of meeting deadlines and
                    maintaining project quality, skills that are invaluable in software development.</li>

                <li><strong>Hands-On Technical Projects:</strong> I have worked on various projects, such as building a
                    sensor-based data logger and a basic embedded controller, which gave me a practical understanding of
                    real-time embedded systems.</li>

                <li><strong>Independent Learning:</strong> I actively pursue courses and resources outside my formal
                    education, deepening my knowledge of real-time systems and advanced C++ concepts to prepare myself
                    for a career in software engineering.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Bringing together my experience in project management and my growing technical skills, I am excited to
                apply my knowledge to real-world software engineering challenges as I complete my studies.</p>

            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>Outside of my studies and projects, I enjoy getting outside and explore nature. Hiking is one of my
                favorite ways to unwind, and I often bring a book along to get a good read with the scenic views. This
                helps me recharge and keeps me grounded outside of the tech world.</p>
            <p>Apart from that, I'm a dedicated gamer. Gaming allows me to unleash my competitive side, and I'm
                currently rank 1 in *World of Warcraft*. Whether it's strategizing solo or teaming up with friends,
                gaming is my go-to for both challenge and fun with good company.</p>
