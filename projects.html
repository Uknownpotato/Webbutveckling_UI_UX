                    <h3>Barcode Scanner</h3>
                    <p>This project involves building a barcode scanner using an Arduino and a scanning component,
                        designed to keep track of your groceries. The system is intended to be placed next to your
                        fridge or pantry, and whenever you buy new groceries, you scan the barcode of the item and add
                        it to your digital inventory. The database stores details such as item names, quantity, and the
                        date of purchase.</p>
                    <p>When it's time for your next shopping trip, the system helps you easily check
                        what you already have, saving time and reducing food waste by letting you know what items are
                        running low. It's an efficient and automated way to manage your kitchen inventory.</p>
                    <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Arduino, Scanner, LCD Display, C++</p>

                    <h3>Memory Sequence Game</h3>
                    <p>In this project, I created a memory sequence game using Arduino, which challenges the player to
                        memorize and repeat a sequence of LED flashes. The game displays a sequence of lights on 4 LEDs,
                        and the player has to replicate the sequence by pressing corresponding buttons. The game becomes
                        progressively more difficult as the sequence length increases.</p>
                    <p>This project helped me understand
                        how to work with input/output devices and manage user interaction. It's a fun and engaging way
                        to practice memory and concentration skills while building practical skills in embedded systems.
